## Installation

Add this to your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem "motion-giphy"
```

Then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

MotionGiphy relies on [AFMotion](https://github.com/usepropeller/afmotion) to run so you'll need to install the neccessary pods.

```
# First get Cocoapods up and running.
$ pod setup

# Now install the needed pods.
$ rake pod:install
```
